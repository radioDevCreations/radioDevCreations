# Hello there 👋

My name is Radek and I am Web Developer from Poland. I work as a Salesforce Developer by day. My passion for programming started when I was in high school and it continues until now. Both in college and privately, I spend most of my time learning web development. Currently I'm focusing on Salesforce and Next.js with Flask back-end. I invite you to check out my projects [here](https://github.com/radioDevCreations?tab=repositories "my repositories").
